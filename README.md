# New Portfolio ~ Bento Style

Hello there! Welcome to my new portfolio, born out of the need to migrate my old portfolio which had been gathering digital dust for about 3 years. It was high time for a refresh, and here we are!

This project was kick-started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and I'm diving back into React after a good long break. So, ðŸš¨ **please don't hate me if things look a bit rusty!** There's plenty of room for improvement, and I'm all ears for any suggestions.

## How to Install

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits. You'll also see any lint errors in the console.

## Room for Improvement

Here's what I'm planning to work on:

- Enhancing the grid layout.
- Improving responsiveness on mobile devices.
- Adding more content...
- And much, much more!

Feel free to fork this repository, create your own version, and contribute back with Pull Requests. Any help to make this better is greatly appreciated!



Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
